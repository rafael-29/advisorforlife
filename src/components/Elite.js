    <span className="theben-span">1. </span>    Life insurance coverage
Secure your loved ones’ future with life insurance benefit worth twice the Face Amount of your plan, providing coverage until age 100 or maturity.
<br /> <br />
<span className="theben-span">2. </span>Enhance your plan with the addition of riders or supplemental benefits which can provide added protection for contingencies such as accidents, disability and illnesses.
<br /> <br />
<span className="theben-span">3. </span>Lifetime guaranteed cash benefits
Enjoy regular guaranteed cash benefits throughout your lifetime, starting at the end of the sixth year of your plan and every two years afterwards. You may also choose to leave your cash benefits with Sun Life to accumulate and be available for future needs.
<br /> <br />
<span className="theben-span">4. </span>Living benefits
Earn dividends from your plan which you may use to increase your insurance coverage, pay for future premiums, leave with Sun Life to accumulate, or receive in cash. In case of emergencies, money also comes in handy via a policy loan against your plan’s cash value instead of borrowing from various financial institutions or selling your prized possessions.
<br /> <br  />
<span className="theben-span">5. </span>A portion of your Face Amount may also be given in advance if the life insured is diagnosed to be terminally ill.
<br /><br  />
<span className="theben-span">6. </span>Manageable premium payments
Pay your premiums regularly on an annual, semi-annual, or quarterly basis. You may also opt for a shorter guaranteed payment period of only 5 or 10 years.
<br /><br />
<span className="theben-span">7. </span>Monthly payment through Auto-Debit or Auto-Charge may also be arranged after payment of the initial quarterly premium.
<br /><br />
<span className="theben-span">NOTE: </span>
Benefits indicated above are subject to the specific guidelines set by Sun Life and the actual provisions of the insurance policy contract.
